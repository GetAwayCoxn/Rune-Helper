# Rune Helper
A simple addon for Ashita v4 to use rune enchantments automatically based on your gui selections. It will also do automatic Viviacious Pulse use based on your gui selections.

Very straight forward to use, the only typed commands are /runehelper or /rh to hide|show the gui, everything else is done from the gui.

Credit to Thorny for his gData.GetBuffCount function from the luashitacast addon, I modified it for my use case.

## To-Do's
I might add valliance/valation use to this at some point in the future

I also might modify this addon for Puppetmaster as well similar to the older pupper addon
